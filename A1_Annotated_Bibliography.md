#### Reference #1: Local Burden of Disease Vaccine Coverage Collaborators. "[Mapping Routine Measles Vaccination in Low- and Middle-Income Countries](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03043-4)". In: *Nature* (2020).
In this article, the authors analyze the variations in coverage of measles-containing vaccines in 101 low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) between 2000 and 2019, both between and within countries, and discuss potential reasons for and solutions to these discrepancies. Measles is a largely preventable disease, with one measles-containing vaccine dose protecting the recipient against disease approximately 93% effectively, yet globally tens of thousands of children continue to die from the disease each year, and more than 99% of these deaths occur in LMICs. The freedom to “protective security,” which Amartya Sen argues is key to increased human development, is breached when individuals in LMICs have unequal access to vaccinations and health care, and thus it is important to provide LMICs with sufficient access to immunizations to propel their development. To address this concern, the researchers focused primarily on answering the following questions:
Has vaccination coverage steadily increased since 2000 or has it fluctuated?
Does vaccination coverage vary between LMICs, and if so, why?
Does vaccination coverage vary within LMICs, and if so, why?
They found that subnational inequity in vaccination access and rollout, which is often masked by global coverage statistics aggregated by country, was high between rural and urban regions within many LMICs, and that this heterogeneity greatly improved between 2000 and 2010 but regressed slightly between 2010 and 2019, with 25 of the 101 countries citing increased geographical heterogeneity in 2019 than in 2000. Overall, increased vaccine coverage was correlated with decreased geographical inequality/heterogeneity in countries over time. Of note, while a greater proportion of countries’ unvaccinated children lived in urban areas, the vaccine coverage rate was significantly lower in most rural areas, which the authors postulated could be due to a lack of resources to preserve vaccines and a lack of healthcare facilities or workers to administer them in rural areas. To me, the most interesting part of this article was the researchers’ focus on subnational geospatial modeling, which clearly and with great detail highlighted the discrepancies between vaccine coverage in neighboring cities and rural and urban areas using extensive survey data.

The authors of this article assert that the biggest challenge facing current vaccination campaigns in developing countries is the uncertainty about target population size and distribution in a given region, especially because these values are constantly fluctuating. Their goal was to develop a dynamic model of population size and distribution in urban Niger to better target vaccination campaigns and prevent children from being missed by rollout efforts. In a number of measles outbreaks over the past 30 years in West Africa, seasonal migration has contributed to a high portion of the youth population missing vaccinations or not being locally present when their areas are the targets of vaccine rollouts, and these unvaccinated children have been drivers of measles spread in their populations, including in Burkina Faso and Niger. These regions were not at risk for outbreaks prior to the wave of children missing vaccinations, highlighting the link between missed vaccinations and infectious disease outbreaks and the great risk they present. Seasonal migration is rarely properly accounted for by vaccine campaigns and is difficult to quantify as it varies from year to year. Current methods of population determination include censuses and surveys, but these estimates are administered infrequently, commonly yield conflicting results, fail to adequately account for seasonal migration, and are biased against developing countries (that is, many of these countries have fewer resources to invest in measures of population or data collection, so their data is often less reliable or frequent). Additionally, the researchers highlight the benefits of integrating across data sources by analyzing information on land use/cover and environmental conditions (like [WorldPop](www.worldpop.org) does), or of using data from mobile phone usage (like [flowminder.org](www.flowminder.org)) to better understand populations, but both methods have their weaknesses/gaps and tend not to properly account for migration or movement patterns. For a highly infectious disease like measles, herd immunity requires at or above 95% populational vaccination, necessitating a high rate of vaccination among children. The questions guiding this research were:
How can we more accurately quantify seasonal migration in Niger?
How can we create a dynamic population model to account for population fluctuations when preparing to administer vaccines?
Bharti et al. used daily, serial satellite images of nighttime lights, which provide a direct, quantifiable indicator of human presence and measure intra-annual population fluctuations, to quantify seasonal population fluctuations in urban areas of Niger. Interestingly (though not surprisingly), they found a statistically significant positive correlation between population size fluctuation and measles transmission in the three largest cities in Niger, providing additional evidence to support the theory that seasonal migration contributes to the risk of increased measles transmission and outbreaks. Using a Susceptible-Exposed-Infectious-Removed (SEIR) model and a Bayesian particle filter, the researchers statistically modeled an estimate of population fluctuation in urban Niger and compared its estimates with the results of follow-up surveys to confirm its accuracy and precision.

In this article, Utazi et al. used geospatial modelling approaches to produce subnational estimates of the vaccination coverage of measles-containing vaccines in Nigeria following a vaccination campaign using post-campaign coverage survey (PCCS) data. Specifically, they analyzed six “indicators”: coverage before the campaign, campaign coverage among previously unvaccinated children, campaign coverage among previously vaccinated children, overall campaign coverage, coverage before *and* during the campaign, coverage before *and/or* during the campaign. All data was collected based upon the 2017-18 Nigerian measles coverage campaign, which targeted children ages 9-59 months, and a PCCS was administered two-to-three months after the campaign by randomly sampling households to gather data for each of the six categories listed above. Additional reference data for previous years was obtained using [WorldPop](www.worldpop.org). To assess potential explanations for discrepancies in vaccination coverage, the researchers assembled a range of geospatial covariates, including datasets relating to remoteness, poverty, livestock, land cover and land surface temperature, and using three different statistical models, they tested the predictive ability and correlation for each and included those that were significant in at least two of the three tests. Using statistical modelling, the researchers identified which covariates were significant predictors of each indicator listed above. As expected, the vaccination coverage before the campaign was most significantly predicted by our covariates of interest, indicating that the campaign worked to more equally distribute vaccinations and combat subnational heterogeneity in vaccine coverage. They were also able to create predictive maps of what the effects of the campaign would be on vaccine coverage with relative success.

#### Reference #4: Portnoy, Jit, Helleringer, & Verguet. “[Comparative Distributional Impact of Routine Immunization and Supplementary Immunization Activities in Delivery of Measles Vaccine in Low- and Middle-Income Countries](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301520317319)”. In: *Value in Health* (2020).
Portnoy, Jit, Helleringer, & Verguet compared the impacts, relative coverage, and breadth of reach of routine immunizations (i.e. those offered by a primary care physician at regular appointments) versus vaccination campaigns to better understand their interrelated benefits to developing countries. In many developing and developed countries, measles disproportionately impacts poorer households, supporting Amartya Sen’s claim that the deprivation of one freedom can often limit another; in this case, a lack of economic freedom often limits households’ access to vaccinations and other forms of healthcare which could help to keep them safe and healthy (“health largely improves with increasing income for many reasons, including differential access to health services according to the opportunities afforded by wealth, especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs)”). They worried that, without considering whom an intervention will reach and who can benefit most from the intervention, delivering public health programs and technologies to mitigate disease burden can further exacerbate wealth inequalities and the lack of freedom among economically-disadvantaged populations. Using data from the Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys multi-country survey, Portnoy et al. conducted a comparative analysis of routine and campaign measles vaccination status of children by wealth quintile to discern the “equity impact” of each method of mass immunization (i.e. to discover whether either method was economically biased). They sought to answer these questions:
What are the differences in impacts between routine immunizations and vaccination campaigns in terms of relative coverage and breadth of reach?
Are routine immunizations or vaccination campaigns disproportionately accessible and/or beneficial to wealthier individuals?
How can vaccine delivery efforts be tailored to better target lower-income populations, who are more heavily impacted by infectious disease spread than their wealthier counterparts?
Although they chose to focus on a broader range of countries and ages, for my future research I found it noteworthy that the burden of measles mortality is highest among vulnerable populations, including children under five, and low-income countries, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Portnoy et al. examined data collected from surveys in 20 LMICs one-to-two years following a vaccination campaign in that country to identify which children had been vaccinated through routine immunization and which through a vaccination campaign. The household wealth index of each child was then quantified and categorized on a scale of wealth relative to their country’s average income: poorest, poorer, middle, richer, richest. The results demonstrated that wealthier households routinely had easier access to routine immunizations, while poorer households were more likely to rely on vaccination campaigns.

#### Proposal:
My vision for this project is to focus on the challenges and disruptions that vaccine rollout programs face in developing countries, although I'm still looking to identify more specifically which challenge or set of challenges I will choose to focus on. Initially, I was very curious about the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the rollout efforts for other vaccine programs, such as Polio or measles that are close to being eradicated in some developing countries, and the proportionally greater impacts that problems in the global economy (such as a global pandemic) can have on developing countries' access to healthcare. However, I struggled to find enough recent research (post-COVID-19 specifically) that utilized data science to properly develop that research interest, so I am choosing to broaden my topic to include other roadblocks to vaccine rollout programs and more generally discuss the current state of immunization efforts. Because most of the articles I read focused on the measles vaccine in West African countries, my guess is that the most data will be available for this region-disease pairing, so I’ll continue to explore their relationship but may expand to include other vaccines to understand the differences in vaccine rollout between vaccines that are easier/more difficult to transport and store or that require a lower percentage of the population to be vaccinated to reach “herd immunity.” I hope to keep my scope small enough to look more into the subnational variation in vaccine coverage that I explored in References #1 & #3 because I think the discrepancies within countries, especially those that vary throughout the year due to seasonal migration, are very intriguing and important to mitigate.
