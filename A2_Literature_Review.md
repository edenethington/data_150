## Literature Review: COVID-19’s Impact on Routine Vaccination Rollout in West Africa

Routine childhood vaccination rollout has helped to effectively eradicate numerous infectious diseases in many nations across the globe by reaching immunization rates that achieve herd immunity and prevent spread of the disease. Infectious diseases like measles and polio, which once impacted the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year, now present no significant risk to citizens due to high childhood vaccination rates, but the same cannot yet be said for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where childhood vaccination rates remain below herd immunity level. According to Our World In Data, as of 2019 more than half of the 19 west African countries reported between 0 and 20% coverage of two doses of measles containing vaccine (MCV) among children, and none of them reached the 95% threshold for herd immunity. These low percentages indicate a need for increased funding and/or intervention to make vaccines more widely available and more commonly received to help LMICs achieve herd immunity against this and other preventable infectious diseases that continue to unnecessarily claim lives.

In his book *Development as Freedom*, economist Amartya Sen defines human development as “the enhancement of freedoms that allow people to lead lives that they have reason to live,” citing freedom as both the goal of development and the means of achieving it. Among those freedoms necessary to development he highlights “protective security” as the assurance of safety and well-being for members of a society. Childhood vaccination coverage sufficient to achieve herd immunity represents a facet of the freedom of “protective security” because it protects members of a society against higher illness and death rates, and thus it is a necessary component to human development in west African countries and other LMICs.

Human development researchers have considered many theories regarding why childhood vaccination rates in LMICs, and specifically in west Africa, have seemingly stabilized at a suboptimal rate in recent years. One of the concerns addressed by the Local Burden of Disease Vaccine Coverage Collaborators (2020) was the high subnational inequity between urban and rural regions in vaccination access and rollout, which is often masked by global coverage statistics aggregated by country. While a greater percentage of LMICs’ total unvaccinated children lived in urban areas, the vaccine coverage rate was significantly lower in most rural areas, indicating that resources may be disproportionately distributed by region to favor areas that are highly populated and have a higher number of unvaccinated individuals instead of factoring in the *proportion* of vaccinated individuals by region at the subnational level. The authors noted that rural areas may also lack the resources to preserve vaccines and the healthcare facilities or workers to properly and quickly administer them as opposed to more technologically established urban areas. These researchers used geological data from hundreds of household-based surveys representing more than 1.7 million children to map high-spatial-resolution estimates of routine MCV coverage across 101 LMICs from 2000 to 2019, and calibrated the estimates to results from the in-depth Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study in 2019.

Another potentially significant contributing factor to the failure of some childhood vaccination rollout campaigns is the variability in population distribution in a given region over time. Bharti et al. (2016) observed that a high proportion of children in west Africa were being missed by vaccination campaigns during periods of seasonal migration that researchers did not account for when creating MCV distribution and administration plans for immunization campaigns, and that these children were significant drivers of measles spread in their populations, including in Burkina Faso and Niger. These regions were not at risk for outbreaks prior to the wave of children missing vaccinations, highlighting the link between missed vaccinations and infectious disease outbreaks and the great risk they present. Seasonal migration is rarely properly accounted for by vaccine campaigns and is difficult to quantify as it varies from year to year. Current methods of population determination include censuses and surveys, but these estimates are administered infrequently, commonly yield conflicting results, fail to adequately account for seasonal migration, and are biased against developing countries (that is, many of these countries have fewer resources to invest in measures of population or data collection, so their data is often less reliable or frequent). Bharti et al. were able to develop a rudimentary dynamic model of population size and distribution in urban Niger to better account for seasonal migration patterns when targeting vaccination rollout programs, and their research highlighted the continued need to observe and factor in population distribution fluctuations when planning vaccine distribution and administration campaigns so nomadic children are effectively included.

There is also considerable inequity in routine vaccination access and reception between wealthier and poorer households in LMICs. Portnoy, Jit, Helleringer, & Verguet (2020) compared the impacts, relative coverage, and breadth of reach of routine immunizations (i.e. those offered by a primary care physician at regular appointments) versus vaccination campaigns to better understand their interrelated benefits to developing countries. In many developing and developed countries, measles disproportionately impacts poorer households, supporting Amartya Sen’s claim that the deprivation of one freedom can often limit another; in this case, a lack of economic freedom often limits households’ access to vaccinations and other forms of healthcare which could help to keep them safe and healthy. Without considering whom an intervention will reach and who can benefit most from the intervention, delivering public health programs and technologies to mitigate disease burden can further exacerbate wealth inequalities and the lack of freedom among economically-disadvantaged populations. Using data from the Demographic and Health Survey and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys multi-country survey, Portnoy et al. conducted a comparative analysis of routine and campaign measles vaccination status of children by wealth quintile to discern whether either method was economically biased, and they found that wealthier households routinely had easier access to routine immunizations, while poorer households were more likely to rely on vaccination campaigns. This inequity demonstrates the need to improve vaccination infrastructure in LMICs so children from poorer households will receive equal access to more reliable methods of immunization through their primary care physicians and highlights the vulnerability of poorer households to lower vaccination rates when external influences halt the progress of vaccine rollout campaigns. 

The COVID-19 pandemic has presented an unprecedented roadblock to vaccination campaign efforts in LMICs, initially due to stringent safety protocols and over time prolonged by the struggling global economy. Banks et al. (2021) used a simple modeling analysis to estimate the additional costs to immunization administration brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic (including the costs of personal protective equipment, social distancing measures, additional training and hazard pay for employees, etc.), and found that on average, vaccine rollout campaigns would incur between a $0.32 and $0.85 increase in the cost per dose of routine vaccines administered, a small but non-negligible cost increment. This cost-per-dose increase exists on top of the fixed additional costs for routine delivery sites and immunization campaign sites, which can range from $12 to $1024 per site, depending on the circumstances, according to their model. These cost increases represent one of the most direct detrimental impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic and its safety protocols on vaccine rollout efforts: increased costs per dose and administration site decrease the total number of vaccines that can be administered with the same budget.

As expected, studies conducted in 2020 and 2021 analyzing recent trends in immunization rates in LMICs found a consistently reduced rate of administration of routine vaccinations, including those for the diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis, meningococcal A, and yellow fever vaccines and first-dose MCV (Causey et al., 2021; Gaythorpe et al., 2021). Causey et al. utilized a two-step hierarchical random spline modelling approach to estimate the reduction in vaccine dose administration from estimated expected values for 2020 and found that first-dose MCV administration was reduced by 7.9% from the expected rates for that year and that approximately 8.9 million children did not receive their first-dose MCV in 2020 due to complications brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. Gaythorpe et al. modeled estimated deaths between 2020 and 2030 due to various infectious diseases whose immunization campaigns were halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic based on 50% reduction in 2020 and postponement to 2021 and found a consistent increase in the number of deaths per 100,000 people of up to 1.3134 for measles. 

While the COVID-19 pandemic has had a widespread detrimental impact on the availability and administration of routine childhood vaccines in LMICs, the heterogeneity of these effects at the subnational level has been inadequately documented and understood. Portnoy et al. (2020) highlighted the reliance of poorer households on vaccination campaigns over routine vaccinations through a primary care physician, the former of which has been disproportionately reduced due to the pandemic, likely translating to a disproportionately heavy burden on poorer households due to the pandemic and a higher reduction in vaccine dose reception among children from poorer households. Similarly, Bharti et al. (2016) observed that children who seasonally migrated were frequently missed by vaccine rollout campaigns, and changes in seasonal migration patterns paired with decreased funding for immunization programs may likely have resulted in fewer nomadic children receiving vaccinations, potentially causing further outbreaks in their communities. The Local Burden of Disease Vaccine Coverage Collaborators (2020) used survey data to demonstrate the discrepancy in vaccination coverage between rural and urban subnational regions, attributing this disparity in part to a lack of success of vaccination campaigns in reaching rural communities, so the impact of COVID-19 on vaccine rollout may likely have differentially impacted rural and urban regions. Chandir et al. (2020) analyzed immunization registry data in Sindh, Pakistan to better understand the heterogeneous subnational effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on immunization distribution and determined that approximately 8438 children were missing immunizations each day during the lockdown. This decrease in immunizations was especially heightened in rural districts and urban sub-districts with large slums. Additionally, the authors noted that some factors correlated with wealth, such as infants born in hospitals and mothers with higher education, also correlated positively with a more sustained rate of vaccinations; in other words, children born to women who were more educated and gave birth in hospitals (both potentially indicative of higher wealth) were less impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in terms of immunization rates. 

Though gathered from a different region, these observations highlight a disparity in the effects of COVID-19 on rural vs. urban households and on poorer vs. wealthier households in Pakistan which suggest the potential for similar disparities elsewhere in the world. Understanding the extent and nuances of these differences in west African households is a crucial next step to understanding how to recover from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic by providing aid in proportion to the burdens carried by different subnational groups and to better prevent against heterogeneous distribution of the healthcare burden of another global economic emergency. Through my research, I hope to better understand the disparities in the effects that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on different subnational groups in west Africa, specifically in regards to populations differing in wealth and urbanization. Because the pandemic is a recent and in many ways still an ongoing global concern, research on the effects of the pandemic is minimal and insufficient, but the sooner we can understand the impacts on LMICs, on different wealth brackets, and on rural vs. urban communities, the sooner we can begin to rebuild most effectively and plan informed social safety nets for the future.
