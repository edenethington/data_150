Routine childhood vaccination rollout has helped to effectively eradicate numerous infectious diseases in many nations across the globe by reaching immunization rates that achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of disease. Highly infectious diseases like measles and polio, which once claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year, now present no significant risk to Americans due to high childhood vaccination rates, but the same cannot yet be said for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where childhood vaccination rates often remain far below herd immunity level. According to Our World In Data, as of 2019 more than half of the 19 west African countries reported between 0 and 20% coverage of two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) among children, and none of them reached the 95% threshold for herd immunity. These low percentages indicate a need for increased funding and intervention to make vaccines more widely available and help LMICs achieve herd immunity against this and other preventable infectious diseases that continue to unnecessarily claim lives.

Myriad data science methods have been applied to develop a holistic understanding of vaccine coverage in LMICs, and two of those most relevant to my research interests are (1) geospatial mapping of vaccination coverage and (2) comparative analysis of immunization activities by wealth quintile. Geospatial mapping aims to visualize the distribution of a given factor across a geographic region, and in the context of vaccination coverage, it uses a gradient to demonstrate the inequity in vaccine administration at the national and subnational level. We can use the results of geospatial mapping techniques to determine how to reallocate funds to best support the most struggling communities. Comparative analysis has been used to compare the reach of different vaccination programs by wealth quintile to determine which methods impact different income brackets most effectively, making it easier to target programs to specific groups in need with the highest efficacy.

The Local Burden of Disease Vaccine Coverage Collaborators (2020) used geospatial mapping to quantify and analyze the high subnational inequity between urban and rural regions in vaccination access and rollout, which is often masked by global coverage statistics aggregated by country (that is, there is a lot of interesting and useful information on inequity between regions within the same country, disparities which are often overlooked when we quantify coverage rates by country). They found that while a greater percentage of LMICs’ total unvaccinated children lived in urban areas, the vaccine coverage rate was significantly lower in most rural areas, indicating that resources may be disproportionately distributed by region to favor areas that are highly populated and have a higher number of unvaccinated individuals instead of factoring in the *proportion* of vaccinated individuals by region at the subnational level. The authors noted that rural areas may also lack the resources to preserve vaccines and the healthcare facilities or workers to properly and quickly administer them as opposed to more technologically established urban areas. 

The researchers used the Global Health Data Exchange to compile 354 publicly-available population-based household surveys from 101 LMICs from 2000 to 2019 containing individual MCV vaccination status and subnational geolocation information for over 1.7 million children. After identifying 26 potential covariates (variables for which data was gathered in the surveys which may correlate in some way with immunization rates), they calculated the variance inflation factor for each covariate and selected those with a score greater than three, meaning they were calculated as most likely to correlate (including nonlinear associations) with immunization rates.

The researchers used stacked generalization, a process which combines the predictions of multiple models into a single ensemble model, to identify complex and nonlinear relationships between the covariates and vaccination coverage by country, and generalized additive models, lasso regression and boosted regression trees were fit, with each model predicting MCV coverage as the outcome of interest. The predictions of MCV coverage obtained from each of the three aforementioned models were in turn used as predictors in the second-step geostatistical model (pictured below). This second-step Bayesian geostatistical modelling framework was used to model vaccination coverage as counts through a generalized linear regression with explicit spatial and temporal terms, leveraging the covariate relationships estimated through stacked generalization while also accounting for additional correlation in coverage across space and time. A separate model of vaccination coverage was fit for each of the 13 defined subregions as defined below:

This method estimates the number of children (C) in a given cluster (d) at a given location (i) and time (t) with a given sample size (N) that have been vaccinated, where p⌄i(d),t(d) is the proportion of children vaccinated with MCV among the target age population in a given cluster. To map the predictions, the generalized linear model was fitted using an integrated nested Laplace approximation. This process produces a set of 1,000 posterior draws, each representing an estimate of vaccine coverage for each location and year (in other words, a set of 1000 candidate maps of coverage from 2000 to 2019). The researchers then calibrated the set of candidate maps to results from the in-depth Global Burden of Diseases, Injuries and Risk Factors Study in 2019 to maintain internal consistency and aggregated the maps to develop predictive maps at the 5km x 5km level, plus uncertainty and probability maps for each 5km x 5km region. They validated their model by leaving out one-fifth of the data at a time, then comparing the results of their algorithm to the withheld observed data.

Portnoy, Jit, Helleringer, & Verguet (2020) used survey data from LMICs where vaccination intervention for the MCV had taken place in the form of measles vaccination campaigns or supplementary immunization activities (SIAs) to determine whether wealth quintile impacted a child’s likelihood to be vaccinated through routine vaccination rollout from a primary care physician or through SIAs. The researchers used surveys from LMICs from the WHO that occurred 1 to 2 years after SIAs. In the surveys, mothers were asked whether their children participated in a specific SIA (with possible answers being “yes,” “no,” or “don’t know”) to determine whether the child had been vaccinated routinely, due to an SIA, or not at all. The surveys also gathered data on household wealth quintile, which they defined as either poorest, poorer, middle, richer, or richest.

Using the survey data, they conducted a comparative, quantitative analysis of measles vaccination coverage and equity at the country level. First, they estimated the measles vaccination coverage by household wealth quintile as the number of children reached by either measles SIA or measles routine immunization program for that wealth quintile divided by the total size of the population in that wealth quintile. Then, they estimated the value of the angle, theta (in degrees), for the ratio of the difference between the coverage levels of adjacent wealth quintiles by using the arc-tangent formula (shown below): 

The researchers conducted pairwise comparisons across all wealth quintiles and averaged them over all comparisons to quantify the inequity between income groups. They found that wealthier households generally had easier access to routine immunizations, while poorer households were more likely to rely on SIAs.

Vaccination rollout efforts have been further hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has delayed or cancelled campaigns in many LMICs and increased the cost and difficulty of immunization administration due to updated safety regulations and social distancing requirements. However, currently there is insufficient research into the heterogeneous subnational effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MCV coverage. Identifying which regions and wealth quintiles were most impacted in terms of routine immunizations will be vital to restoring and making up for these programs in order of need.
