## Abstract: Measles-Containing Vaccine Coverage in West African Countries

Routine childhood vaccination rollout has helped to effectively eradicate numerous infectious diseases in many nations across the globe by reaching immunization rates that achieve herd immunity and prevent the spread of disease. Highly infectious diseases like measles and polio, which once claimed the lives of tens of thousands of Americans every year, now present no significant risk to Americans due to high childhood vaccination rates, but the same cannot yet be said for many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs), where childhood vaccination rates often remain far below herd immunity level. According to Our World In Data, as of 2019 more than half of the 19 west African countries reported between 0 and 20% coverage of two doses of measles-containing vaccine (MCV) among children, and none of them reached the 95% threshold for herd immunity. These low percentages indicate a need for increased funding and intervention to make vaccines more widely available and help LMICs achieve herd immunity against this and other preventable infectious diseases that continue to unnecessarily claim lives.

Myriad data science methods have been applied to develop a holistic understanding of vaccine coverage in LMICs, and two of those most relevant to my research interests are (1) geospatial mapping of vaccination coverage and (2) comparative analysis of immunization activities by wealth quintile. Geospatial mapping aims to visualize the distribution of a given factor across a geographic region, and in the context of vaccination coverage, it uses a gradient to demonstrate the inequity in vaccine administration at the national and subnational level. We can use the results of geospatial mapping techniques to determine how to reallocate funds to best support the most struggling communities. Comparative analysis has been used to compare the reach of different vaccination programs by wealth quintile to determine which methods impact different income brackets most effectively, making it easier to target programs to specific groups in need with the highest efficacy.

Vaccination rollout efforts have been further hindered by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has delayed or cancelled campaigns in many LMICs and increased the cost and difficulty of immunization administration due to updated safety regulations and social distancing requirements. However, currently there is insufficient research into the heterogeneous subnational effect of the COVID-19 pandemic on MCV coverage. Identifying which regions and wealth quintiles were most impacted in terms of routine immunizations will be vital to restoring and making up for these programs in order of need.
