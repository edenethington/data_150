### Prompt: Joshua Blumenstock states that a humbler data science could transform international development while also limiting the number of alleged silver bullets that have missed their mark in recent years. Describe the promise, pitfalls and ways forward Blumenstock uses as the foundation for his thesis. Additionally, consider the following statements from three of your classmates regarding this article. (1) "Good intent is not enough in data science when dealing with the problems which determine people's experiences" Anna Raymond (2) "Transparency is the underlying issue to many of these problems, so an increase in this on both ends (data based issues & human based issues) could lead to better results." Nira Nair (3) "In lieu of such drastic potential for promoting applications yet demoralizing hinderances, the balancing act can become difficult." Kayla Seggelke How do you respond to these ideas regarding "good intent", "transparency" and the difficult "balancing act" when considering the intersection of human development with data science? Please prepare your response for next Thursday's class.

#### In his article *Donâ€™t Forget People in the Use of Big Data for Development*, Joshua Blumenstock warns human development researchers against relying solely on unverified "big data" brought about by the recent influx in digital information collection and instead urges them to use it as another source of verification for preexisting data collection tools. The recent immense advance of technological data collection tools has enticed many researchers to speed up and generalize their methods of data analysis, which are used to inform human development aid efforts across the globe, and this expedited process has fed into two defining traits of big data, each with their own disadvantages. The first is that, using big data, data scientists aim to generalize large sums of information to make overarching assumptions about human development and community health, and while recognizing patterns can be immensely helpful in developing large-scale policy recommendations and aid plans, generalization inherently ignores the complexity and diversity of the global human condition and guides researchers to one-size-fits-all solutions rather than individualized plans for success. The second trait of data science using big data is its ability to quickly amass and develop assumptions based on massive data samples from anyone with access to the internet or a smartphone, giving researchers the dangerous ability to expedite the data analysis process by relying solely on data collected through new technological tools. While impressively vast and in-depth, these methods of data collection lack standardization, transparency, and verification, and Blumenstock adds they are exceptionally prone to becoming out-of-date, sometimes within a matter of months. By relying on big data for quick, broad results, data scientists often ignore the biases and shortcomings of these methods' reach, including demographics that they ignore (e.g. people without access to cell phones or the internet) and confounding variables they fail to take into account. Rather, Blumenstock advocates for the powerful supplemental role of big data in human development research, providing a second source of data against which to validate our previous methods of data collection and which can be useful in filling the gaps of more time-intensive and less broad methods such as individual interviews or surveys. By serving only a supplemental role, these technological tools can lean into their strengths of generalization and breadth to provide another source for and view of homan development data without sacrificing the integrity of the research at hand and in many ways strengthening it to be more holistic.
