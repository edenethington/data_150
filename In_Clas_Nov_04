## Suggested Reading/Viewing for Class

### By Eden Ethington

#### Prompt: We have five reading/watching slots left on our schedule. I'm looking to replace one that's there now I think is on the weaker side (Thursday 11/18) and I want your help. What topic haven't we discussed (or will discuss) within the realm of data science and/or human development that you would like covered and discussed in class? Is there a particular video or reading you are aware of that you like or think is valuable that you want the rest of the class to see/read? Briefly explain your thoughts and provide a link, if applicable.

I would love to have a class discussion centered around the future of the data science profession/field -- how it will look 10/20/50 years from now, what skills are most important long-term, etc. I was reading [this article](https://towardsdatascience.com/data-scientists-will-be-extinct-in-10-years-a6e5dd77162b) my mom had sent me recently (trying to dissuade me from majoring in data science haha) that discussed how perhaps a lot of the data analysis specialized skills that data scientists are learning may become a bit obsolete in the near future at the rate that ML is progressing; that is, soon computers may have the capabilities of doing all the technical things we spend so much time learning (like writing code, developing algorithms, conducting extensive data analyses). This got me thinking a lot about how I want to invest my time in college so that I come away with skills and abilities that are more *human* in nature or will not likely be able to be made obsolete by computers, and maybe choosing to focus my time on developing better problem-solving skills, honing my ability to understand and extrapolate from processed data, and maybe even specializing in a field or fields to which I think data science could be applicable so I'm better informed for a future job. While I'm not necessarily saying in the short term we'll have to worry about our jobs becoming obsolete or computers completely overtaking the scientific method, I think the issue discussed in the article presents an interesting start to a dialogue about the future of the field that I'm sure you and others have plenty of thoughts on. I would guess that if we used an article like this, it would make sense to supplement it with one or a couple other points of view (videos/articles) so we could have a more informed discussion, but I'd love to talk about something like this because it seems very directly applicable to those of us interested in this or a related field (and also just for all students trying to find/curate their professional niche).
