## Human Development Index Short Essay

### By Eden Ethington

#### Prompt: Since this is a course on human development, I think you should be aware there exists a "Human Development Index (HDI)". This index attempts to quantify the level of human development of a country. It was developed by Pakistani economist Mahbub ul Haq and Indian Nobel laureate Amartya Sen. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) compiles the HDI of 189 countries in their annual Human Development Report. You can see the latest rankings [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_Human_Development_Index). It attempts to place people at the center of the development process in terms of economic debate, policy, and advocacy, and is framed in terms of whether people are able to "be" and "do" desirable things in life. The indicators used in the 2020 report were life expectancy at birth, expected years of schooling for children, mean years of schooling for adults, and gross national income per capita. These indicators are used to create a health index, an education index, and an income index, each with a value between 0 and 1. Read [this](http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/human-development-index-hdi) for an overview.
#### Do you think additional information or data could be added to the HDI calculation to possibly improve it or make it a more accurate measurement of human development? If yes, what things? If no, why no? Keep in mind the conversation with Tyler Cowen.

I really enjoyed reading more about the HDI because I'd heard/read it in passing in some of our past viewings and readings, but I hadn't looked into it further. One of the things I found most interesting was the fact that HDI calculations from previous years aren't comparable to each other or the most recent calculations because each year, improvements are made to the indexing process that change the baseline, so researchers will recalculate past years with the current indexing process for reference. I would be very curious to learn how calculating HDI has evolved over the past 30 years in more depth and will try to learn more about that on my own time.

I was initially very impressed/surprised by the simplicity of the calculations (i.e. I expected there to be many more factors taken into account, not just three), and I'm curious as to how accurate and consistent across countries this metric is as a result. (I also don't know how you test the accuracy of a metric that attempts to quantify something as qualitative as human development.) Hearing that Amartya Sen was a co-developer of the HDI, I anticipated it would incorporate more indicators of the different types of freedoms he mentioned in his book, Development as Freedom, but perhaps in practice those freedoms cannot practically be given the same weight as other more established measures of progress. I was *incredibly* surprised to see that Mahbub ul Haq and Amartya Sen didn't incorporate GDP at all -- even if you view it as an oversimplification, it generally has a lot of predicting power -- but I am certain this was a very deliberate decision marking their disdain for the metric (in fact, I'm sure they developed the HDI as a replacement, or at the very least a supplemental measure, for GDP). Thinking back to the interview of Tyler Cowen we listened to in this class, I would argue that the HDI is not a suitable standalone measure without either incorporating GDP into its calculation or also considering GDP in a given context. GDP may not directly measure the direct impact of human development on individuals' lives, but it is a tried-and-true metric that has consistently estimated human development with relative success, and it is still a very useful if incomplete measure to account for when estimating a country's holistic human development.
