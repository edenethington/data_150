## Facial Recognition Privacy

### By Eden Ethington

#### Prompt: Read [this November 2nd article](https://www.npr.org/2021/11/02/1051504165/facebook-delete-facial-recognition-data-privacy) on a change in use of facial recognition technology by Meta (formerly Facebook) (hat tip to Arthur). What are your general thoughts on government and private company utilization of technologies that are able to recognize a face and/or match a human face from a digital image or a video frame against a database of faces? What advantages or benefits could/do such technologies provide? What role (if any) should a government play in regulating their use by individuals or companies?

I feel like my response is coming from a place of almost complete ignorance (i.e. I've heard a lot of people express concerns about this sort of issue but I don't yet feel informed enough to have very strong feelings either way), but I guess I don't necessarily understand what all the fuss is about. Because I've grown up almost exclusively in an age where much of my personal information isn't truly private/I am not well-equipped to ensure its privacy, this sort of thing feels less to me like an invasion of privacy and more normal/expected. I don't really see why a private company would owe its users the security of the data they willingly hand over (e.g. photos, names, contact info), especially when we're using the service for free, and although I don't have any issue with governmental regulations (I think they're great!), I don't feel as strongly that they're necessary or a human right based on my limited understanding. 

I definitely agree with the issue brought up in the article about the danger of facial recognition software misidentifying criminals or suspects, and the fact that there's a technological bias on the basis of race completely invalidates the software in its current form for me. I think one of the risks of our current booming age of AI development and improvement is that these sorts of technologies are widely available and (too) quickly implemented without weighing the challenges involved. It's important for software like this one to be stringently tested on a wide variety of cases before being implemented in such a directly impactful (and potentially harmful) way to people's lives. However, I'm not sure how feasible it is for the government to create regulations based on how accurate/successful a new technology is, and I don't think that same level of stringency is necessary or really relevant for private companies/social networks. I will try to learn more about the specific grievances people have with facial recognition software so I can better understand why I might be more opposed to it.
