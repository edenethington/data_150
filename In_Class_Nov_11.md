#### Prompt: Read [this October 2020 article](https://penntoday.upenn.edu/news/role-data-world-reshaped-covid-19) from UPenn that's a set of statements by faculty from a broad array of fields on the ways in which data and data science are contributing to or affecting their field with respect to COVID and the pandemic (hat tip to Rhea).
#### Write 1-2 paragraphs on the following: From what you know about your prospective major, what is a permanent or semi-permanent way the pandemic has affected your field of study or an aspect of culture or society related to your field? Do you believe the change is a net-positive or negative for society and why? What recommendations (if any) would you have for your field moving forward on the issue? For example, if you're a prospective business major, what are your thoughts on remote work and the use of office spaces and how businesses could think about "where" to work moving forward? Or, if you're a prospective psychology or sociology major, how has the virus and pandemic changed how people and societies view and react to germs?

Although data science was perhaps the most benefited/advanced by the COVID-19 pandemic, I think all scientific/computer-focused fields of study were definitely impacted, both in their areas of focus and how they are formatted. I'm currently planning to study CS and CAMS Mathematical Bio, and I know that one thing to come out of the pandemic is an increased awareness and application of these fields (much like data science) in other disciplines. This past year I worked in a clinical research lab which in previous years was typically divided into the bioinformatics/machine learning section and the "wet sciences"/biological section. However, I watched the pandemic transform the format of the lab (as we went from largely in-person to largely at-home), with most initially biology-focused members picking up a bit of basic computer science skills to better function virtually. I think this "nudge" to develop baseline coding skills was a huge benefit to our lab, and probably to many members of our and other disciplines, because it created an increased level of shared understanding between specialists in our field and the CS/data science professionals who handle a lot of our data. Knowing where our information is coming from and how its being processed is super important to trusting the results!

On the flip side, I think one negative impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on some fields like biology, public health, and applied CS/data science is that, with the amount of pandemic-related information that became widely available and discussed, the general public has a lot more confidence in their knowledge of the fields, often to a fault. I think it has become increasingly difficult for doctors and scientists to maintain "expert status"/credibility because laymen with a higher level of common knowledge now feel more confident questioning or disagreeing with expert opinions and scientific study results. And don't get me wrong, critical questioning is incredibly important, vital even, to the research process, but in our present age of immediate and widespread information dissemination, the idea of spreading misinformation (whether that be legitimately false information or just oversimplified/overgeneralized claims) threatens the legitimacy and importance of specialists in these fields.
