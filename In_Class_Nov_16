#### Prompt: Read the article ["The Data Science Behind Self-Driving Cars"](https://medium.com/@feiqi9047/the-data-science-behind-self-driving-cars-eb7d0579c80b) (hat tip to Connor). In 1-2 paragraphs, write what you think (or know) are the broad implications for society from the development and adoption of self-driving vehicle technology. What are the positive aspects, the not so positive, and the important considerations (e.g., ethical)?

I loved getting the chance to read a more technical data science article since most of what we've read so far has focused solely on the implications of data science in a much more theoretical context, although I know more than a few of the logistics went over my head. I know that some people have more background knowledge on this topic -- to be perfectly honest, I don't have a ton of personal interest in it, so I haven't taken the time to research or better understand personally -- but I'm coming into this with little-to-no understanding of the current state of the discussion surrounding the data science ethics of self-driving cars. I imagine that the "end goal" of this technological development is to eliminate the need for human drivers as a profession (e.g. truck drivers or cabbies) and perhaps in daily life, too (although I think that application is a lot further out because it requires significant time for turnover of all the vehicles currently in circulation). Ideally, the goal of making these jobs obsolete is to give drivers the opportunity to pursue "better" (i.e. higher paying and less physically demanding) careers and achieve a higher quality of life, which I think is a fantastic goal, but the two main issues I predict are (1) a transition time of "growing pains" as drivers are put out of work without the education, skills, or means to pursue other, "better" jobs and (2) a lack of replacement jobs created as a result of this automation. Regarding the former concern, this is not a
