#### Prompt: Read the article ["The Data Science Behind Self-Driving Cars"](https://medium.com/@feiqi9047/the-data-science-behind-self-driving-cars-eb7d0579c80b) (hat tip to Connor). In 1-2 paragraphs, write what you think (or know) are the broad implications for society from the development and adoption of self-driving vehicle technology. What are the positive aspects, the not so positive, and the important considerations (e.g., ethical)?

I loved getting the chance to read a more technical data science article since most of what we've read so far has focused solely on the implications of data science in a much more theoretical context, although I know more than a few of the logistics went over my head. I know that some people have more background knowledge on this topic (i.e. self-driving vehicles) -- to be perfectly honest, I don't have a ton of personal interest in it, so I haven't taken the time to research or better understand personally -- but I'm coming into this with little-to-no understanding of the current state of the discussion surrounding the data science ethics of self-driving cars. I imagine that the "end goal" of this technological development is to eliminate the need for human drivers as a profession (e.g. truck drivers or cabbies) and perhaps eventually in daily life, too (although I think that application is a lot further out because it requires significant time for turnover of all the vehicles currently in circulation). Ideally, the goal of making these jobs obsolete is to give drivers the opportunity to pursue "better" (i.e. higher paying and less physically demanding) careers and achieve a higher quality of life, which I think is a fantastic goal, but the two main issues I predict are (1) a transition time of "growing pains" as drivers are put out of work without the education, skills, or means to pursue other, "better" jobs and (2) a lack of replacement jobs created as a result of this automation. Regarding the former concern, this is not a long-term concern, nor is it unique to this technological advancement over any other, but as we've discussed in class previously, there is generally a few-decades-long period of transition when new technology is introduced to replace jobs because, while future laborers can choose to avoid that career path in the future, current employees are generally put out of work without many options to apply their career skills which have recently been made obsolete. This most frequently detrimentally impacts laborers who do not have post-secondary education or attended vocational school because their field-specific skills and experience do not "roll over" or apply to other careers very easily. I don't know exactly how this problem has been or could be addressed at an institutional level, but from the individual level it nearly always requires a career path change and learning curve. As for the latter issue, I was mainly thinking back to our listening from last week where the speaker (I think Jaron Lanier?) had mentioned how translators had been made increasingly obsolete by new technology, but that while those developing the technology had defended their work by claiming that new jobs would be created to train and fine-tune the algorithms, they ended up drawing their inputs from free, publicly-available translation work people had posted on the internet. Because of this, the elimination of one career path didn't result in the creation of new, "better" jobs and instead simply took away the opportunity for these laborers to be paid for their skills. I anticipate a similar issue with vehicle automation; even if new jobs are created in, say, data/computer science, these jobs don't necessarily offer an opportunity to the same demographics who were cut out of the job market, perhaps people who cannot afford to attend college or for whom physical labor is a more appealing career option. I can't imagine this is an issue any institution/private corporation/government would take responsibility to do much of anything about, nor am I sure such a solution even exists, but I'm very curious as to how in the long-term the makeup of available jobs will shift, specifically in the ratio of manual to intellectual labor.
