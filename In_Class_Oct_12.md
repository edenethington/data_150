#### PROMPT: Read [this press article](https://www.wsj.com/articles/hidden-debt-plagues-chinas-belt-and-road-infrastructure-plan-studies-find-11632866461) on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), a Chinese global infrastructure development plan. What are your thoughts, or more saliently, what questions do you have or what would you want to know/learn more about? What responsibilities do you think the international community should have (if any) on such matters?

This was definitely a worrisome article to read! To be completely transparent, as a biology/CS major and STEM-focused student, I've often failed to keep informed on the current state of foreign affairs and had almost no prior knowledge on this subject (which is part of what made it scary!). I was most prominently struck by the concern of exploitation of these developing nations by the Chinese government/Chinese lenders because of the seemingly calculated way in which China had planned the BRI to offer immense high-interest loans. The article cited AidData as estimating that "on average [China's foreign lending] carries interest rates four times higher than offered by other bilateral lenders and maturity periods of a third as long," and this statistic points to the biggest problem here in my opinion which is that these developing nations seem not to have another viable option for the magnitude of loans they need (in other words, China must have a monopoly, at least virtually so at this level of demand), or else they would undoubtedly choose lower interest rates and later maturity dates. Regardless of China's intention, loaning billions of dollars to developing nations at an inflated interest rate sets these nations up for long-term debt, financial instability, and undesired Chinese power/influence over their governments. And I have reason to believe this *is* in fact China's intention, seemingly evinced by the carefully-designed nature of the BRI. 

It is very difficult to assess what responsibility the US and other members of the international community bear in protecting developing nations from exploitation because, bottom-line, interference will require providing an alternative source of these essential funds for countries currently borrowing from China. The Group of Seven's B3W plan to devote $200 billion to foreign investment is a promising start, but the program will necessitate considerable economic expansion to make a sizeable impact on the current foreign loans market China has effectively monopolized in developing nations. It may also be worthwhile to offer economic advising services to developing nations' governments where the US and others cannot directly offer loans to instead inform them of the long-term risks of China's loan offers.
