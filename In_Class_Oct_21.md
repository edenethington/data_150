## Dan Runfola Lecture Reflection

### By Eden Ethington

#### Prompt: After Dan's lecture, I would like to reinstill a bit of empirical optimism regrading the progress of humanity. Despite the very real difficulties data scientists, humanitarians, developers, and other leaders face, progress is being made over large time scales.
#### [Go to this website](diamandis.com/data) (a supplement to Peter Diamandis's 2012 book "Abundance") which illustrates various forms of progress across multiple dimensions of human well-being. Pick a topic heading. Write a description of each of the trends you see, i.e., for each figure. Do you think each trend actually represents progress? If not, why do you think? Finally, with Dan and A. Sen in mind, what do you think could be barriers to progress in each topic? (another way to think about this is: why do you think progress hasn't occurred even more rapidly?)

For my topic, I chose the category labeled *Increasing Happiness & Increasing Equality* because I wanted to focus on something positive after Dan's slightly depressing albeit incredibly informative lecture. I feel like increasing happiness and equality are some of the best measures of quality of life legitimately improving because, while we might not always be aware that crime rates are lower or healthcare access is higher in our area than they were 100 years ago (we grow accustomed to our new normal), when we measure these facets of happiness or equality, they often indicate that the population of interest is aware of their improved quality of life.

Figure 1: Annual Hours Worked per Person (1870-1978)

This figure displays a decreasing trend in the number of hours worked per person per year in each of the US, France, Japan, and Brazil, noting a 50% reduction in the US (for whom data is available for all years presented on the graph). Two things I would be curious to learn to better understand this graph are (1) whether this graph incorporates data from all working-age individuals or just the labor force (i.e. people actively seeking and/or in a job) because that would impact whether the data is pulled toward zero by people who can't or don't intend to work and (2) what the median number of hours worked per year is because I suspect it may be higher than the average since most of these averages are substantially lower than the number of hours worked annually by a standard full-time employee (~1500 average compared to ~2000 for a full-time worker). 

Figure 2: Number of Democracies

This graph demonstrates a large increase in the number of democratic regimes globally since 1800, with a large jump between 1950 and 2000. While I do think this graph represents an increase in freedoms globally to some extent, it would be important to understand the researchers' functional definition of a democracy because some governments might self-identify as democracies without meeting the standard we generally hold democracy to in the US. Additionally, I think this graph would be more helpful if it instead showed the number of democracies globally as a proportion of the total number of nations/governments because the number of total countries could potentially have increased during a certain time period, making the increase in democracies during that time less surprising (we need context).

Figure 3: Percentage of Degrees Awarded to Women (in the US)

In this graph, we observe a slight dip in the percentage of degrees awarded to women leading up to the 1950s, but overall there is a sizable increase in the percentage of degrees awarded to women in each of the five categories (Bachelor's, Master's, Doctoral, Law, Medical) over time, with women even receiving the majority of Bachelor's and Master's degrees. I wonder whether this trend does not follow for Business degrees (a notoriously male-dominated field) since they do not include that data. I absolutely believe the trend evidenced in this graph provides evidence of increased equality of opportunity in the US because education offers women increased socioeconomic mobility and financial independence.

Figure 4: Closing the Gender Earnings Gap

This graph is sadly a bit depressing. While the ratio of earnings of working women to working men increases toward 1:1 between age brackets (i.e. the 15-24 age group has a consistently lower wage gap than the 25-44 age group, and the same between 25-44 and 45-64), there has not been a steady increase in the ratio for the youngest age group from 1993-2011, indicating that while at the generational level there seems to be some improvements made over the last 100 years, there is much less progress to report in the last 20, perhaps because some view this issue as already addressed or solved.

Figure 5: Are Tech-Savvy Countries Happier?

This graph displays a positive correlation between a nation's "techiness" and its happiness score. While there is some inevitable/expected variability, I was surprised to see just how correlated these two factors are across dozens of countries globally. I would be curious to understand the happiness index they used and how many people they sampled, but I think this graph provides pretty strong supporting evidence that "techiness" correlates with happiness. I would not be inclined to presume that these factors necessarily have a causal relationship, however; my best guess is that they are both caused by another shared variable, perhaps a nation's wealth or wealth distribution, and that while technology is a means by which life can be made easier/more free, it is not the sole, direct cause of increased happiness.
