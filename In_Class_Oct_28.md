## Application of Data Science

#### Prompt: To give you a better idea of what data science is and how is compares to other areas in the world of work read this 10-15 min article. Taxonomically, in academia, data science is a subfield of computer science. Personally, I see data science as a tool or a set of tools and methods that a researcher or practitioner of data science applies to data in a particular domain.  This combination is their "craft", in essence. I, for example, apply data science to geography in the context of international development. This means I use tools such as machine learning on data such as satellite imagery to help solve problems in the international development community. Data science is a domain that can be surprisingly hard to define given its broad applications and newness. I don't necessarily think there's one correct definition and, whatever it is, the field will continue to evolve with new technologies, new industries, and/or new issues. There's also a question of skill ranges. Should the title of "data scientist" be reserved for those with doctoral degrees in the same way it is in physics, for example, and anyone below that is basically something else (like an analyst)?
#### Think about an area of study or field you care about (outside of your formal assignment topic), maybe the major you intend to choose. Based on what you read and know about data science and its related areas (data analysis, stats, and ML), briefly (1-2 paragraphs) write about how you think these disciplines could possibly be used in your field (it's okay to think ambitiously). If methods are already being used, what are they and to what extent (if you know)? If you are a prospective data science major, what ideas do you have for how data science could be used in ways you believe they are currently not?

I'm so glad this is the prompt for today because it's something I've been thinking a lot about recently in considering what I want to pursue career-wise. I'm hoping to double major in Computer Science and CAMS Mathematical Biology at W&M for this reason; I love the wet sciences but can see the immense marketability and applicability of computer science and mathematical analysis in pretty much any field I could want to pursue. I hope that by studying statistics and CS, I can curate skill sets that will be more useful to employers and give me the opportunity to work in areas that I love even more. Exactly like you were saying, I think that data science and the adjacent fields of study are not so much disciplines to specialize in but rather a set of tools that can be applied to almost any discipline to better understand what has happened and predict what may happen next. The reason data science *matters* is because we care about the trends and outliers in biology or art history or sociology -- the value of analyzing data is not inherent but derived from the "why?". 

This past year, I had the opportunity to intern in a bioinformatics-based bone marrow failure lab at the NHLBI, and that experience really opened my eyes to the application of computer/data science in the medical research field. We worked with massive amounts of sequenced genome data which would take our team thousands of hours to sort through by hand, but using data science methods we were able to design algorithms that identified variants of interest in a given genome and determined the likelihood that each was causing a patient's disease in a matter of seconds. My dream would be to use computer/data science for similar lab research because there is direct purpose/inherent value in using data to understand a person's illness and find their best treatment options. Like Dan Runfola discussed briefly with us when he visited class, data scientists can sometimes get caught up in what is possible without considering the feasibility or real impact, so I want to find a way to apply CS/data science that is directly meaningful and impactful and not just get caught up in the numbers for their own sake.
