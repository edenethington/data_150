## Our World In Data: Response

#### Prompt: I want to introduce you to another source of sociology-focused data: Our World in Data, founded by Max Roser. Select a topic you are curious about from the dropdown "Articles by topic". Technological Progress, for example. If the topic is lengthy, you can pick just a graph or two. Two cool things about the site are (1) there are concise descriptions of the topics, definitions of terms, and references; and (2) most ( if not all) the plots have their data available for download as a csv. Their COVID plots are some of the best and up-to-date. This one, for example is robust with its many metrics, but it's simple and easy to manipulate as well. Similar to 9/30's essay, write what topic (or graph(s)) you are looking at. Describe what you see. Are there trends? If so, what are they? Does anything surprise you? Where possible, connect what you see to previous readings, discussions, or your experiences.

For this activity, I chose to look at the *Returns on Education* topic from the drop-down menu, which was labeled as "preliminary data" and contained two graphs. The one I found most interesting was the graph of [*Labour cost ratio and attainment levels*](https://ourworldindata.org/returns-to-education), which demonstrated the ratio of the relative costs of labor of tertiary-educated individuals (i.e. college and beyond) and of below upper-secondary-educated individuals (i.e. didn't complete high school or international equivalent) for laborers ages 45-54. The ratios were represented as a function of the proportion of 45-54-year-olds with tertiary education which I found especially interesting because I might not have considered the implications of income disparity on how many people choose to pursue higher education. Additionally, having been raised in a home and school district that highly valued college education, I felt pretty blind to the fact that not a single country with data on this topic had a tertiary education rate at or above 50%, meaning that receiving a college education isn't the path the majority of adults in any country pursue. Just based on these data, I can't determine whether the researchers included vocational schooling as a form of tertiary education, but I'd be curious to know that because it would probably impact the proportions, especially in some European countries where vocational education is more widespread.

As displayed by this data, there is a slight negative association between the labor cost ratio and and the proportion of tertiary-educated adults ages 45-54. At first, I was surprised by this trend because I had presumed that a higher educational income gap would encourage more adults to pursue tertiary education, but I realized that, although that might also be true, it's likely that I was interpreting the trend backwards in terms of cause and effect. I suspect the bigger factor at play is that the fewer individuals who are tertiary-educated in a country (i.e. the more rare higher education is), the more coveted those professionals are/the more specialized, valuable, and necessary their work is and thus the higher institutions are willing to pay them. The US is the main country that falls a bit above the line/curve of best fit, meaning the educational income ratio is higher than expected for the proportion of adults who are college-educated, but I think this makes sense in my mind because we tend to emphasize the importance of a college degree here more heavily (and many employers refuse to hire employees without college degrees), so I imagine that explains the higher proportion of individuals with a degree and the higher labor cost ratio.
