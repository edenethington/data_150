## Short Essay on Human Development

#### Prompt: Human development has been described by Selim Jahan (head of the UNDP program) as “development of the people (capital), for the people (translated to the lives of people) and by the people (people are not only receiving but active participant in the process).” How have we done as a humanity to fulfill this hope originally manifested through the Gettysburg address? Does data science have a role to play in advancing the human condition? What role does complexity play in advancing our understanding of global human development processes and their multitude of dimensions? In order to predict valuable solutions to some of the world’s most intractable problems, will combined domain expertise from the perspective of computer science & statistics with global human development be sufficient, or is a new integrated paradigm needed? What hope do we have in selecting the best future path for humanity?

What I find most insightful about Selim Jahan's definition of human development modeled after the Gettysburg Address is the distinction between the goal (development of the people), the purpose (development for the people), and the means (development by the people). The first on its own is generally how I (and I think many others) view human development more singularly, but including the other two facets of human development implicates us as individuals in the process of ensuring the success of human development ventures. *We* are the ones who have something to gain from this form of development; it is our right to pursue human development that best meets the needs of our communities (for the people), and it is our responsibility to help make that happen (by the people). I believe that Jahan's definition of human development conveys a bit of an idealized view of what human development researchers, and all people, should keep in mind and value when considering their responsibilities and goals in development efforts, and while I don't think we've routinely succeeded as a humanity to fulfill this goal, human development efforts that deliberately focus on a smaller, more human scale are consistently more in tune with the population they're serving and thus more beneficial to and more well-received by that population.

Data science and Big Data have played an undeniably massive role in democratizing access to human development information globally and in aggregating data at an unmatched magnitude for research purposes. The greatest strengths of data science are also its weaknesses to which we must pay the most attention. Data science presents the unparalleled opportunity to quickly and accessibly observe patterns and trends in massive amounts of data and to reach relatively cheap, inexpensive conclusions without being barred by the limitations of needing to be on-site in a location or talking individually to members of a population of interest. Removing these barriers to data collection and analysis means labs need significantly less funding to understand their populations and conduct research and gives virtually everyone with internet access the ability to analyze Big Data and draw reasonable conclusions, and this increased democratized access to information greatly contributes to the mission of human development research. However, in aggregating and identifying trends in colossal data sets, data scientists can over-rely on the conclusions drawn from data alone without understanding exactly how the data was collected, giving adequate attention to outliers, or considering the complexity and unquantifiable nature of human life and development. Providing inexpensive online access to these data sets means sometimes researchers need not even visit locale they're attempting to provide aid to, let alone speak with members of that population, and in this streamlining process we lose the importance of "development...for the people," an integral component of Jahan's definition and the intended purpose for all that human development researchers do. I feel strongly that, like Joshua Blumenstock argued in [his article on Big Data](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06215-5), there is a strong future for the application of data science to global human development so far as it plays a supplemental role in the collection, analysis, and understanding of data, but that we *must* maintain the necessity and importance of directly working with and hearing from the people a human development project is attempting to serve as the primary means of identifying and achieving our goals. In this way, we can continue to prioritize the human component of human development and not "forget people in the use of Big Data for development" (Blumenstock).
