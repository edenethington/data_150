## In-Class Gapminder Essay

### By Eden Ethington

#### Prompt: Go to the [Gapminder data site](gapminder.org) (founded by Hans Rosling). The x and y axes can be changed with the little arrows. The year can be changed with the slider at the bottom. You can even have the plot play through time. Each bubble represents a nation and can be selected and deselected in the right panel. There's a two minute "How to" video at the top as well.
#### Pick at least one configuration (life expectancy vs income in the UK and Cuba over the past 80 years, for example). Try any combination(s) you like (no wrong answers here). Write what data you are displaying. Write about what you see or what surprises you, if anything. As best you can, connect what you see to ideas in previous readings from Rosling, West, Sen, another course, or from your experience.

For this activity, I chose to look at [Polio immunization rates among one-year-olds in four countries](https://www.gapminder.org/tools/#$model$markers$line$encoding$y$data$concept=pol3_vacc&space@=country&=time;&source=fasttrack;&scale$type:null&domain:null&zoomed:null;;;;;;&chart-type=linechart&url=v1): The United States, Russia, China, and Nigeria. In my opinion, these countries represent an interesting breadth of geographical location, governmental structure, ideologies, and recency/rate/current level of development. I already knew that vaccination percentages among the first three countries I selected would be close to 100% at present, but I was curious to see the fluxuations and trends over time. The first thing I noticed was the time at which each country's Polio immunization data became available: for the US it was 1979, for China 1981, for Nigeria 1983, and for Russia 1991. I was surprised that Russia's immunization percentages had not been recorded (or are not publicly available from) earlier because I was inclined to consider Russia a more developed, though largely rurual, country from before and during the Cold War (although as I'm writing this I'm recognizing that, in its present form, *Russia* has only existed since 1991 -- no data documented on Gapminder for the USSR so I can't be sure whether they simply didn't make it public or whether it simply wasn't recorded here). Of course, documentation doesn't necessarily say a lot about a country's vaccine rollout efforts -- both China and Russia reported greater than 65% Polio immunization rates among one-year-olds at the time that their data begins on Gapminder -- but I find the discrepancy between their start dates interesting and would love to better understand whether it's due simply to Gapminder's data source(s), whether these countries didn't make their immunization rates public until later (and why/why not), or whether they didn't document Polio immunization rates until later in the 20th century. 

The second thing that stuck out to me was the fluxuations in the data, and especially whether they were seemingly correlated or independent between countries, because while each country has experienced a net increase in immunization rates from their data's "start date" until present day, they vary pretty drastically in fluxuations over time. Surprisingly to me, the immunization percentages are roughly correlated between China and Nigeria, although I don't believe they've had many trade/governmental relations, so my best guess is their similar inclines/declines are due to fluxuations in the availability of the Pol3 vaccine on the global market. The US and Russia are more closely matched, experiencing more gradual changes over the past 40 years than the other two countries. Nigeria is the only country to have a sharp decline in the past 30 years (in fact, they have two), and I suspect this is due to a heightened sensitivity to the fluxuations of availability of Pol3 vaccines on the global market as well as the state of the global economy. Because they are a less developed and relatively poorer country, decreased availability of vaccines may price them out of accessing vaccines, and aid from the US and other countries/organizations (e.g. Doctors Without Borders), which is a driver of vaccination implementation in many developing countries, will decrease when the global economy is struggling.
