## Introduction
Hi I'm Eden Ethington and I'm a freshman at William and Mary from Fairfax, VA (NoVA). I have two younger siblings and a dog at home that I miss a lot right now! I'm still trying to figure out what I want to study, but I'm hoping to double major in CAMS Bio and either CS or Data Science with a goal of working in research. I love to take morning walks, cook, and watch football, and I'm passionate about mental health advocacy. I have some experience with computer science in the past and am excited to learn more about the policy and human development aspects of data science/analysis because it's a completely new topic to me!
