## Introduction
Hi I'm Eden Ethington and I'm a freshman at William and Mary from Fairfax, VA (NoVA). I have two younger siblings and a dog at home that I miss a lot right now! I'm still trying to figure out what I want to study, but I'm hoping to double major in CAMS Bio and either CS or Data Science with a goal of working in research. I love to take morning walks, cook, and watch football, and I'm passionate about mental health advocacy. I have some experience with computer science in the past, but this is my first time using R. I'm so excited to be in this class and get to know everyone better!
