## Introduction
Hi I'm Eden Ethington and I'm a freshman at William and Mary from Fairfax, VA (NoVA). I have two younger siblings and a dog at home that I miss a lot right now! I'm still trying to figure out what I want to study, but I'm hoping to double major in CAMS Bio and either CS or Data Science with a goal of working in research. I love to sew/embroider, take morning walks, eat ice cream, and cook, and I'm passionate about mental health advocacy. I'm so excited to be in this class and get to know everyone better!
