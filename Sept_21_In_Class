## Truncated lightning round questions:

### 1. What was the toaster project? What did Thomas Thwaites attempt to do? Was he successful and what is the significance of this example in the context of complexity and development?

#### Thomas Thwaites’s goal of the toaster project was to individually create a toaster from scratch by performing every step of the creation process himself, from harvesting raw materials to shaping parts to assembling the machine. Through a nine-month process, Thwaites was able to recreate a technically workable version of a cheap toaster he’d found at a grocery store, and although it combusted soon after completion because Thwaites could not find rubber to insulate the wires, he considered it a “partial success” because it did initially work.

#### Although Thwaites was successful in creating and assembling a toaster by himself, the process was significantly more time-consuming and expensive than the streamlined production process of the toaster he’d purchased for merely £5, and the product was much less usable.

### 2.  According to Barder, how successful have economic models been at describing and predicting growth over the past 50 years?  How did he use the Harrod-Domar model, the Solow model, the Washington consensus and the Ajaokuta Steel works to illustrate his point (reference at least two of the above).

#### In Barder’s opinion, past economic models have been relatively unsuccessful at predicting growth over the last 50 years because they seek to find the one “missing ingredient” and in doing so fail to account for the immense complexity and coevolution of developing systems and often disregard the work and insight of previous models. For example, using the Harrod-Domar model of economic growth, economists claimed that, if each of the elements of development in the cycle were sequential and had cause-and-effect relationships, then simply increasing investment would create a domino effect that catapulted all developing nations into a self-perpetuating cycle of increased development, without accounting for the potentially stark responses different countries’ economies would have to similar inputs. The Solow model, which attempted to extend the Harrod-Domar model to better account for complexity, simply summed up the additional unaccounted for variable as “technological progress,” an ethereal and ill-defined measure of productivity that could be quantified but not clearly addressed/aided. Both models looked for a single solution, but Barder argued that economic models had to account for complexity rather than look for the one answer.

### 3.  Who was Steve Jones? What did he do at Unilever? Was he successful?  Specifically what did he do in order to make an evolutionary jump forward?  How significant were his results?

#### In what I found to be the most interesting part of the video, Owen Barder recounted Steve Jones’s experience developing nozzles for soap production at Unilever. Jones was tasked with developing a more effective nozzle that would expedite the process of separating soap crystals from the liquid, and, not knowing what would make a most effective nozzle, Jones followed the evolutionary process of random mutation by creating ten random alterations to the current nozzle shape, selecting the most effective iteration, and randomly altering that one, continuing for 45 “generations” until he had a nozzle which was 20% more effective than the original, although no one could explain exactly why. Jones’s results demonstrated the immense power of evolutionary adaptation in selecting for efficiency even when we don’t know what solution is best or why a given adaptation is the “most fit”, and they made a case for the benefits of encouraging experimentation as a means of achieving the most promising innovations in developing nations.
