## In-Class Personal Essay

#### Prompt: I'd like to get to know you better. What is your general background---in a few sentences, what do you want me to know about you? What are your interests academically, intellectually, or professionally? Basically, what do you care about (no wrong answers here)? What do you think data science is? Based on your conception of data science, in a very broad sense, how (if at all) do you think it can be harnessed to improve the lives of people (their quality of life), the environment, our understanding of ourselves or nature, business & economics, everyday problem solving, or anything else?

Hi Ethan! My name is Eden Ethington and I'm a freshman from Northern Virginia hoping to study CAMS Mathematical Bio and Computer Science at W&M. I attended a STEM high school for the past four years, so I'm really passionate about the sciences and clinical research specifically, but I deliberately chose to attend a liberal arts college because I'm really excited to be around students who are passionate about and excellent in a more diverse range of fields. I have a bit of programming experience from high school, and this past year I did an internship at an NHLBI lab that really got me excited about the intersection of computer/data science and biological research, but besides that I have virtually no experience with data science, especially as it relates to human development, so I'm really excited to be in this class as a complete novice to learn more about the application of data science elsewhere. More specifically when it comes to human development, my mom ran a non-profit in Ouelessebougou, Mali for six years when I was younger, and my uncle has worked for the World Bank and multiple human development think-tanks for most of his career, so I have a lot of familial exposure to the importance and complexity of human development aid/research, and I wanted to learn more so that I could (hopefully) begin to have more interesting conversations with them about their experiences.

In my personal life, I'm very close with my parents and younger siblings and chat with them most days, and I have a dog named Stella at home whom I miss a lot! I am a big college football fan (my family's team is the Utah Utes), and a couple weeks ago I got a job with the football team here helping out during practices/games and organizing their equipment which has been a really enjoyable way to satisfy my work-study aid requirements and a great way to get outside and be active during this transition to college life. 

I guess my conception of data science so far, based off of my previous experience and what we've learned in class, is that it's the science of collecting and analyzing digital data to answer questions and solve problems. Data scientists, much like any other field's researchers, start with a question, develop a robust way to gather new or vet existing data, and use digital and mathematical tools to search for patterns and outliers among the data. The goal of data science is to answer questions with a general rule or solution, almost always with outliers, so researchers can develop necessarily broad policy recommendations for governments to implement. Because of this generalization, data science can be immensely helpful for identifying overarching patterns in human development and community succes/failure, leading to a greater common understanding of our nature and the nature of the societies/world we live in, but it can also present problems if we rely on it too heavily. Data science's goal and greatest strength also represents its most common shortcoming; by generalizing big data for a more broad application, it fails to account for the complexity, individuality, and ever-changing nature of human development patterns between nations, and even in the same nation over time. I wonder if, like Joshua Blumenstock mentioned in [his Nature article](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-06215-5), whether data science is best utilized as a preliminary step in the research process, helping answer our more broad questions with general patterns
